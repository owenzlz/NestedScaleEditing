## Introduction

We proposed an image synthesis approach that provides stratified navigation in the latent code space. We achieve this through scale-independent editing while expanding scale-specific diveristy. Scale-independent is achieved with a nested scale disentanglement loss. Scale-specific diversity is created by incorporating a progressive diversification constraint.
